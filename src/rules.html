      <p>
        升级 is a family of trick-taking card games popular in China. It's also
        known as tractor (拖拉机), 40 points (四十分), 80 points (八十分),
        playing for 100 points (打百分), finding friends (找朋友), among
        others.
      <p>
        This online 升级 and 找朋友 implementation uses a fairly standard rule
        set. There are a wide variety of house rules that aren't implemented;
        but could be -- feel free to propose new functionality on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rbtying/shengji">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Deck</h2>
      <p>
        There are 54 cards per deck (13 cards per suit, plus a <span class="🃟">small joker</span> and
        a <span class="🃏">big joker</span>). Aces (A) are treated as
        higher-valued than Kings (K). Usually, a deck is added for every two
        players in the game (so 4 players and 5 players play with 2 decks, but
        6 players play with 3).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kings, tens, and fives are valuable cards and have point values. Kings
        and tens are worth ten points each. Fives are worth five points each.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Scoring in each round of the game is determined by "point" cards. Only
        fives, tens, and kings have points&mdash; all other cards do not count
        for scoring.  Point scores are pooled within a team.
      </p>
      <table border="1">

          <tr><td>Card number</td><td>Point value</td></tr>

          <tr><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr>
          <tr><td>K</td><td>10</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Each deck has a total of 100 points (25 per suit).

      </div>
      <h3>Player ranks</h3>
      <p>
        Each player in the game has a rank, starting at 2 and going to A. If
        they win rounds, their rank may increase. The rank of the leading
        player for a round determines the trump rank for that round.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game ends when a player successfully defends a round at the A
        rank.
      </p>

      <h2>Trumps and Suits</h2>
      <p>
        In each round, there is a trump specification which determines what
        cards are part of the trump suit. The trump specification always
        includes a trump rank, but doesn't necessarily include a specific suit.
        Jokers are always a part of the trump suit.
      </p>
      <h3>Trump with a specified suit</h3>
      <p>
        For example, if the trump rank is 4 and the specified suit is spades
        (<span class="♤">♤</span>), the trump suit consists of all 4s, all
        jokers, and all spades. A card can only be a part of one suit, so the
        <span class="♡">4♡</span> is no longer considered to be a members of
        the hearts (<span class="♡">♡</span>) suit.
      </p>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play" id="trump-4s"></div>
        <div class="label">
          Trump suit when specification is <span class="♤">4♤</span>

        <div class="label">
          Hearts suit when specification is <span class="♤">4♤</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In all suits, the 3 and the 5 are now considered to be adjacent.</p>
      <p>
        The order of the trump suit is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All non-trump-rank numbered cards of the specified suit, in their
          normal order</li>
        <li>Cards of the trump rank, but not of the specified suit. Note:
          these are considered to have equal value to one another</li>
        <li>Cards of the trump rank in the specified suit</li>
        <li>All jokers, in their normal order</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the case of the trump specification of <span class="♤">4♤</span>,
        the ordering from highest to lowest is
        <span class="🃏">big joker</span> &gt;
        <span class="🃟">small joker</span> &gt;
        <span class="♤">4♤</span> &gt;

          <span class="♡">4♡</span> =
          <span class="♢">4♢</span> =

        <span class="♤">K♤</span> &gt;

        <span class="♤">8♤</span> &gt; 
        <span class="♤">7♤</span> &gt; 
        <span class="♤">6♤</span> &gt; 
        <span class="♤">5♤</span> &gt; 
        <span class="♤">3♤</span> &gt; 
        <span class="♤">2♤</span>.
      </p>

      <h3>Trump with no specified suit</h3>
      <p>
        If only a trump rank is specified (and no suit), the only trumps are
        cards of the trump rank, and jokers. This is referred to as "no trump",
        and there are five distinct suits (as opposed to the usual four).

      <p>In all suits, the 3 and the 5 are now considered to be adjacent.</p>
      <p>
        The order of the trump suit is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cards of the trump rank. Note: these are considered to have equal
          value to one another</li>
        <li>All jokers, in their normal order</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the case of the trump specification of 4NT,
        the ordering from highest to lowest is
        <span class="🃏">big joker</span> &gt;
        <span class="🃟">small joker</span> &gt;
        [
          <span class="♤">4♤</span> =
          <span class="♡">4♡</span> =
          <span class="♢">4♢</span> =
          <span class="♧">4♧</span>
        ].
      </p>

      <h2>Teams</h2>
      <p>
        There are two fundamental teams in the game: one team is trying to
        acquire points, while the other team is trying to discard them.
        Colloquially, the team trying to acquiring points is "attacking", and
        the other team is "defending".
      </p>
      <p>
        The defending team is determined by a designated leader of the team
        (当庄). In 升级, the teams are fixed and the leader rotates among the
        winning team. In 找朋友, the leader rotates among the team that won the
        previous round, but the teams are fluid and change from round-to-round.
      </p>
      <p>
        The leader (whomever is 当庄) of the team gets an additional advantage
        at the beginning of the game: they can see the extra "bottom cards"
        (底牌) and exchange them for cards in their hand. Otherwise, all
        players are the same, and teams only matter for scoring.
      </p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <h3>Bidding for trump</h3>
      <p>
        The game begins by players drawing cards one at a time. Like most
        Chinese card games, cards are drawn in counter-clockwise order.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any point, a player may "bid" for the trump by showing valid bids
        out of their hand. The highest bid determines the trump specification
        for the game. However, once a player has made a bid, they can only
        "reinforce" it by adding more of the same card, or wait for another
        player to displace them as the highest bidder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valid bids must be made up of identical cards (i.e. same card-face).
        The bids can be either cards of the current trump rank or jokers. The
        current trump rank corresponds to the rank of the leader of the
        defending team. Each game starts with all players at rank 2. Joker bids
        represent "no trump" bids. A single joker cannot be used as a bid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bid made must be greater than all of the previous bids. This is
        determined first by the number of cards (more is higher), and then by
        card values (following the "no trump" ordering of card values).
      </p>
      <p>
        The final trump specification is determined by the winning bid. If the
        winning bid is made up of jokers, the trump specification is "no
        trump"; otherwise, it is the suit of the winning bid. All cards in this
        suit and jokers are considered trumps..
      </p>

      <p>Example with trump rank of 2:</p>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card ♤">🂢</span>
        </div>
        <div class="label">
          Player 1's bid
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card ♢">🃂</span>
          <span class="card ♢">🃂</span>
        </div>
        <div class="label">
          Player 3's bid
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card 🃟">🃟</span>
          <span class="card 🃟">🃟</span>
        </div>
        <div class="label">
          Player 1's second bid
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Result: 2NT trump specification, player 1 wins the bid.</p>

      <p>
        If this is the first round being played, the winner of the bid is also
        the leader of the defending team (当庄). Otherwise, the only
        consequence of the bidding process is setting the trump specification.
      </p>


      <h3>Exchanging cards with the bottom (底牌)</h3>
      <p>
        After the drawing phase is completed, 4 to 8 cards are left in the
        bottom of the draw pile and become the 底牌. For example, in a
        four-player game, there will be 8 cards left; in a five-player game,
        there will be 6. These cards are made available for the leader of the
        defending team (当庄) to pick up.
      </p>
      <p>
      <p>
        The leader may choose to swap some, all, or none of the cards in the
        bottom for cards in their hand. The number of cards in the bottom must
        remain constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a potential penalty for hiding points in the bottom, since
        other players can't see them. This is surfaced as a multiplier on the
        number of points left in the bottom, which are treated as if they are
        attached to the last trick in the game.
      </p>
      <table border="1">
        <thead>
          <tr><td>Length of the last trick-format</td><td>Point multiplier</td></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2 (e.g. pair)</td><td>4</td></tr>
          <tr><td>3 (e.g. triple)</td><td>6</td></tr>
          <tr><td>4 (e.g. tractor)</td><td>8</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        The multiplier can be generalized to arbitrarily large trick-formats.
        In the case of the last trick-format being a "throw", or a set of the
        highest possible individual trick-formats, the length of the longest
        trick-format within the group should be used for the multiplier.
      </p>

      <h4>Declaring friends in 找朋友</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to exchanging cards with the bottom of the deck, in games
        of 找朋友, the leader also specifies which cards identify their
        "friends" (i.e. members of the defending team). These must be committed
        to at the beginning of the game, and the leader is allowed to become
        their own friend (intentionally or unintentionally).
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of friends is determined by the number of players&mdash; the
        defending team should never be larger than the attacking team.
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend is declared as a combination of a specific card (suit/number)
        and an ordinal. For example, one could declare that the "first person
        to play an <span class="♤">A♤</span>" is their friend. They could also
        declare that the third person to play the card is their friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards above the value of A cannot be declared as friends. That is,
        cards of the trump rank and jokers are not legal friend cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases, this results in the leader and the other players not
        knowing who the friends are. Once a trick has been completed in which a
        person has played the friend card, they join the defending team and
        bring their points with them.
      </p>

      <h3>Playing tricks</h3>

      <h4>Trick formats</h4>
      <p>
        All cards in a trick format must be in the same suit.
      </p>

      <h5>Single cards</h5>
      <p>
        Any single card can always lead a trick. Other players are required to
        play a card in the same suit if they have one; otherwise, any card can be
        played.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a trump card is played, the highest trump card wins the trick.
        Otherwise, the highest card in the original suit wins the trick. If the
        same card is played by multiple players, the first one to play has
        precedence.
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card ♤">🂢</span>

          <span class="card ♤">🂭</span>
        </div>
        <div class="label">
          Player 2
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card ♤">🂡</span>
        </div>
        <div class="label">
          Player 3
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card ♤">🂡</span>

        <div class="label">
          Player 4
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Player 3 wins this trick, because they played the highest card in the
        same suit (<span class="♤">A♤</span>) first.
      </p>
      <p>Example 2:</p>
      <div class="labeled-play">
        <div class="play">
          <span class="card ♤">🂢</span>

          Player 4
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Player 2 wins this trick, because they played the highest trump card
        (<span class="🃏">big joker</span>). Note that Player 3 is also void in
        spades (<span class="♤">♤</span>), but did not play a trump card
        and so cannot win the trick.
      </p>

      <h5>Identical cards (doubles, triples, four-of-a-kind, ...)</h5>
      <p>
        Sets of identical cards can always lead a trick. Other players are
        obligated to match the set as best they can.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: cards of equal value are not necessarily identical; they have to
        have the exact same card face.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if the trick-format is triples, the ordering of required plays is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Triples in the same suit (note: triples which are part of a four-of-a-kind or other type of play are not special or protected)</li>
        <li>Doubles in the same suit, along with another card in the same suit</li>
        <li>Three cards in the same suit</li>
        <li>Two cards in the same suit, along with a card in any other suit</li>
        <li>One card in the same suit, along with two cards in any other suit</li>
        <li>Any three cards</li>
      </ol>

        Only plays which match the trick-format (either in the original suit,
        or in trump) are eligible to win the trick. As with the single-card
        format, the first player to play an identical play has precedence.

      <h5>Tractors (consecutive groups of identical cards)</h5>
      <p>
        Consecutive sequences of at least two identical cards of the same size
        and in the same suit are called tractors, and are a special play-type
        in and of themselves. They are parameterized by their length and the
        number of identical cards, both of which are at required to be at least
        two (the smallest tractor is four cards).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if the trick-format is tractors made up of three
        consecutive pairs, the ordering of required plays is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Three consecutive pairs in the same suit</li>
        <li>Two consecutive pairs in the same suit, along with another pair in the same suit</li>
        <li>Three pairs in the same suit</li>
        <li>Two consecutive pairs in the same suit, along with two other cards in the same suit</li>
        <li>Two pairs in the same suit, along with two other cards in the same suit</li>
        <li>One pair in the same suit, along with four other cards in the same suit</li>
        <li>Six cards in the same suit</li>
        <li>Five cards in the same suit, along with another card in any other suit</li>
        <li>Four cards in the same suit, along with two cards in any other suit</li>
        <li>Three cards in the same suit, along with three cards in any other suit</li>
        <li>Two cards in the same suit, along with four cards in any other suit</li>
        <li>One card in the same suit, along five cards in any other suit</li>
        <li>Any six cards</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Only plays which match the trick-format (either in the original suit,
        or in trump) are eligible to win the trick. As with the single-card and
        identical-card formats, the first player to play an identical play has
        precedence.

      <h5>Throws (sets of the highest possible individual trick-formats within a suit)</h5>
      <p>
        Any set of the highest possible trick-formats in a given suit can be
        played simultaneously as a "throw". It is expected that the player
        initiating a throw believes that their play is valid, i.e. that no
        other player can defeat any component of the throw using cards in the
        same suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a throw has been played, each player should (in counter-clockwise
        order) affirm that the throw is valid and that it cannot be defeated
        within the same suit. If the throw is determined to be invalid, the
        player which initiated the throw is obligated to lead with the
        component that can be defeated. In this implementation, no additional
        penalties are imposed on incorrect throws.
      </p>
      <p>
        In cases of ambiguity between components (e.g. five-of-a-kind vs.
        tractor), the interpretation with the longest single component is
        chosen. If there are multiple ambiguous components of the same length,
        tractors are preferred over identical cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other players are not obligated to ensure that their plays are the
        highest possible plays within their own suits, though they still need
        to match each component's trick-format as best they can.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only plays which match the trick-format (either in the original suit,
        or in trump) are eligible to win the trick. As with the other formats,
        the first player to play an identical play has precedence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: in order to defeat a throw, every component of the throw must be
        individually defeated. Since a throw is only valid if it cannot be
        defeated within its own suit, this means that a throw can only be
        defeated by the same pattern of cards in the trump suit.
      </p>

      <h4>Trick structure</h4>
      <p>
        In each trick, the first cards (also known as the lead cards) denote
        the format of the trick. Only plays which match the trick's format are
        eligible to win the trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every player contributes the same number of cards to each trick.
        Therefore, every player runs out of cards at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Players are also obligated to match the trick format to the fullest
        extent possible: if they are able to match the format within trick's
        suit, they must play those cards. If they can't match the format but
        can match a looser variant of the format (e.g. they have a pair in the
        suit, but the format requires a triple), they are also obligated to
        play those cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that a player can only play cards of a different suit than
        the leading play in a trick if they have no cards in that suit (i.e.
        they are void in the suit).
      </p>
      <p>
        The winner of the current trick will play the first cards (and set the
        trick format) for the next trick.
      </p>

      <h3>Winning the round and leveling up</h3>
      <p>
        The winning team for each round is determined by the number of points
        the opposing team earned from tricks. If the opposing team won the last
        trick, the cards hidden in the bottom are revealed. The point value of
        any valuable cards at the bottom are multipled by the number of cards
        used to lead the last trick and awarded to the opposing team. 
      </p>
